# 3701ICT_FavouriteThings
Using SWIFT UI and following the Model-View paradigm develop a application that can track your favourite objects / items e.g. food.
The Mobile IOS application is to be developed using the AGILE methodology with milestone submissions every 2-3 weeks.
The application uses core data in the back end to save models and their objects.
The project also contains a unit testing file for testing both the model and view of the application.
